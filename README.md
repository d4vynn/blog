My name is Maya and I'm currently an 18 year old college freshman majoring in computer science. After graduating with my Bachelor's Degree, I intend to work full-time as a software engineer. I currently have a certificate in web development and am in the process of studying for CompTIA's CySa certification. Aside from programming, my hobbies include reading romance novels, writing, and dabbling in automotive photography. 

I seek to hone my skils in programming and am learning HTML, CSS, Javscript, and Python.
