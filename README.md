My name is Maya and I'm currently an 18 year old college freshman majoring in computer science. After graduating with my Bachelor's Degree, I intend to work full-time as a software engineer. I currently have a certificate in web development and am in the process of studying for CompTIA's CySa certification. Aside from programming, my hobbies include reading romance novels, writing, and dabbling in automotive photography. 

With my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python, I hope to build a career that allows me to work on projects that allow me to express creativity, hone my skills, and build relationships with fellow programmers.
