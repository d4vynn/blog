After graduating with my Bachelor's Degree, I intend to work full-time as a software engineer in Florida. I currently have a certificate in web development and am in the process of studying for CompTIA's CySa certification. Aside from programming, my hobbies include reading romance novels, writing, and dabbling in automotive photography. 


With time, I hope to build a career that allows me to work on projects that allow me to express creativity, hone my skills in programming, and build relationships with other programmers.
